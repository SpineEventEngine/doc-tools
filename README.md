# Doc Tools
This repository contains tools for working with Dokka and Javadoc:

 * [`ExcludeInternal`](javadoc-filter/README.md) — a Doclet for removing Javadocs for types
   annotated as `@Internal`.
 * [Javadoc Style Formatter](javadoc-style/README.md) — improves the style of Javadocs of the code
   generated for Protobuf types.
 * [Dokka exclude @Internal plugin](dokka-exclude-internal-plugin/README.md) - a Dokka plugin for 
   removing code annotated as `@Internal` from documentation.
