# Javadoc Tools
This repository contains tools for working with Javadoc:

 * [`ExcludeInternalDoclet`](javadoc-filter/README.md) — the tool for removing Javadocs for types
   annotated as `@Internal`.
 * [Javadoc Style Formatter](javadoc-style/README.md) — improves the style of Javadocs of the code
 * generated for Protobuf types.
